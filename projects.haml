          Stripe callbacks are used to determine when to perform particular events such as sending out welcome emails, setting up new username/password combinations, provisioning new VPN servers, etc. 
        %p
          Currently shell scripts are used to automate new user creation as well as VPN server provisioning but will migrate to Chef or Puppet in the future for server provisioning.

          since it allows dynamic discovery of new nodes. Nagios requires that a static environment to perform monitoring, which is not feasible for my production setup because a new VPN server may be provisioned automatically at any time.

            The Domain Crawler is a robot that crawls the web and determines if outbound links from seed URLs contain domains that are able to be registered directly from a registrar without having to go through aftermarket auctions or sales. These domains are valuable because they were once live sites and already have inbound links; therefore when set up again, many of them have excellent SEO metrics and a better chance to rank or pass along authority when linking to other sites.
        %p 
          %em 
            %strong Technology
          %br
            Originally, <a href="http://anemone.rubyforge.org">Anemone</a> was the web crawler software, but unfortunately it wasn't stable enough to use in production due to memory leaks. I switched to Scrapy (written in Python) which boasted significant speedup and stability over its Ruby counterpart. After Scrapy retrieves all outbound URLs from seed domains, those domains are stored in Redis. Sidekiq workers are then used to retrieve the domains from Redis and queue domain availability checking. Duplicate jobs are filtered to prevent redundant work and there is a nice control panel to monitor status. Since worker tasks can be run in parallel, the system is extremely fast and scalable.
          %br
            The user facing frontend is a Rails app that uses Devise for authentication and authorization. Regular users can just browse the list of domains available for registration, and can sort by different metrics to determine a domain's value and whether or not it is worthwhile for registration. Admin users can run the crawler, clean up the domain list by removing spam, and administrate users. Data is cached via memcached to improve performance by reducing the need to retrieve information from disk.

            Since the WordPress shared host server is in Texas, I use nginx on a VPS located in California as a transparent reverse proxy to serve the Chinese site in order to help reduce latency and page load time. This has resulted in dramatic loading time improvements, from a pathetic 28s load time to just under 10s through a Chinese internet connection for a 180% speedup.

          Snowboards for Women was created because I love snowboarding and wanted my to help my then girlfriend choose a snowboard so she could come with me on trips. It was difficult to find a women's snowboard so I used
          %a{:href => "http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/"} Beautiful Soup,
          a Python HTML parser, to scrape the outdoor retailer websites for women's boards. I later found out that each merchant had datafeeds with affiliate links so I switched to that, created a website, and after learning and implementing SEO the site makes me a healthy amount of passive income every winter.

          Originally the site was just a list of women's snowboards and their links scraped using Beautiful Soup and some regular expressions for personal use. I've since grown it to be a CodeIgniter web application with bash scripts that fetch datafeeds and parse them automatically to keep prices current via cron jobs.
        %p
          There is also email marketing integration through,
          %a{:href => "http://www.mailchimp.com"} Mailchimp
          with a custom written
          %a{:href => "http://www.snowboardsforwomen.com/recommend"} snowboard recommendation engine

          Since the Snowboards for Women business model was so successful, I wanted to duplicate it in other markets as well. As a result, I completely rewrote the framework to build Trekking Poles Guide, which does not have the seasonal problem that Snowboards For Women suffers from. This framework is modular enough to be used for virtually any price comparison / review aggregation site, and I plan on using this framework to build a new outdoor gear review site every month.

          %em 
            %strong Technology
          %br
          Everything has been refactored to be clean and reusable, with necessary abstractions to make it easy to generate a new product site using the framework without excessive premature optimization. The code is stored in a private Mercurial repository on
          %a{:href => "http://www.bitbucket.org"} Bitbucket.
        %p
          All of the tedious tasks such as downloading and parsing data feeds to obtain up to date prices have been automated using shell scripts run via cronjobs, so after building a site the technology portion will be pretty much hands off so I can focus on customer service and marketing.

          The Ultimate Guide to Programming Interviews was created when I began my job hunt after college. In preparation for the technical interviews commonly given for software developer positions, I collected many of the practice questions that I came across while reviewing. I also included my own coded answers and detailed written explanations for the solutions. Friends asked for the document which I originally kept in a Word file, but it got old emailing them updated versions so I decided to just put all the content on a website.
        %p According to Google Analytics, the Ultimate Guide to Programming Interviews consistently gets over 6000+ unique visitors per month. Every single visitor is acquired organically - I do no advertising of any sort, including word of mouth. The site is ranked #1 or #2 for the keywords "programming interview" and "programming interviews" and has a Google PageRank of 5.

            The site was created using Jekyll and Haml; it used to be a Sinatra app deployed on Heroku. However, I had some issues with the fact that the single Heroku dyno would idle and 
            take a long time to boot when someone requested the site for the first time. 
        %p
          As a result, I experimented with using nginx as a transparent reverse proxy 
          to cache the site contents and serve them directly as static pages from nginx. This worked well until I realized I had a ton of coursework that was only
          hosted on my shared host and my VPS didn't have enough disk space to handle it so I ported everything over to Jekyll and now just serve static HTML pages
          through nginx on my shared host.

    %br
    Since I used to work at Lime Brokerage, a high volume, high throughput brokerage whose clients were all professional black box algorithmic traders, I really got into automated trading myself. Unfortunately, company policy prevented employees from doing any automated trading but I used my time there to learn a lot about the financial markets.
  %p After leaving Lime, I found some likeminded people including previous coworkers who had also left the company and we started a project to develop and backtest trading strategies. Originally we were going to use off-the-shelf software like Amibroker or WealthLab but quickly determined that these solutions were insufficient to do any serious, minimal latency, high volume day trading, so we decided to write our own backtesting framework.
  %p
    %em  
      %strong Technology
    %br
    The backtesting trading framework is written in Java.
    %a{:href => "https://jdic.dev.java.net/"} JDIC (Java Desktop Integration Components)
    and Swing provide a GUI for visual analysis of historic strategy performance.
    %a{:href => "http://www.junit.org"} JUnit
    serves as the unit testing framework.
    %a{:href => "http://subversion.tigris.org"} Subversion
    is our source control and it is coupled with
    %a{:href => "http://jenkins-ci.org"} Jenkins
    (previously Hudson) for continuous integration. A post commit hook was created so we get email alerts whenever a build is broken or fixed. Forward testing of strategies is done through a PaperTrading account at
    %a{:href => "http://www.interactivebrokers.com"} Interactive Brokers
    through their Trader Workstation (TWS) Java API using custom wrapper classes. Bug tracking is done via RedMine.
  %p
    %em 
      %strong Methodology
    %br
    Our team of six is geographically distributed throughout Boston, San Francisco, and Shanghai. We collaborate mostly through email because it is asynchronous but hold Skype conferences to brainstorm and make important group decisions. Otherwise, work is done remotely on our own time schedules, since different people may have different busy periods. Every team member has various specialties (mine are system administration, strategy development, and Interactive Brokers API integration) but anyone can work on any part of the system.
  %p
    We share information about infrastructure, including logins and such using
    %a{:href => "http://www.dokuwiki.org"} DokuWiki.
    Decisions are made by prototyping instead of debating; whoever has the best prototype moves forward with their design, and consensus is always reached quickly as a result of the quality of the prototype. We are agile and loosely coupled, so nobody needs to wait on another's progress to continue forward. There are legal structures in place to prevent any IP problems, but as a result I am unable to share further details regarding this project, especially code.

          Ranktracker.io is an automated solution for checking search engine rankings of sites; it was created to help quantify Search Engine Optimization results for my own projects.
        %p
          It crawls Google search results daily for keywords you specify and checks the rank of web pages you own in order to track their movements and alert you if there are significant changes in rankings. Since higher rankings yields higher targeted website traffic, this is a really big deal for any business with an online presence in order to acquire customers cost effectively.

            %strong Technology
          %br
          To store ranking data, a Redis list is used along with some business logic to create an in-memory round robin database. This allows users to quickly see historical data in graph format while keeping the relational database clean.
        %p
          <a href="https://github.com/rails/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a> is used to help speed up page load times so that performance is similar to a JavaScript framework client like backbone / Ember / Angular without needing to do client-side MVC. This is because the ranktracker.io frontend is slightly heavy due to the Rickshaw graph library, but Turbolinks removes the need to reinterpret the JavaScript and CSS on each page load.
        %p
          Iron.io Workers are used as distributed crawlers to check Google search results, allowing massive parallelization with the added benefit of not triggering any rate limiting.
        %p
          ApiAxle, a Node.js application that serves as a reverse proxy into the ranktracker.io RESTful API, is being integrated which will help with rate limiting clients, providing analytics, and caching data for faster response times.
