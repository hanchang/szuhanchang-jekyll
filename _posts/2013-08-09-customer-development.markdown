I've been feeling uneasy lately about ranktracker.io and today I nailed it down to the fact that there's plenty of competition out there, but I'm not setting apart my current vision of ranktracker.io from them.

As a result, I'm addressing that concern by performing some customer development ahead of time to make sure that there is actually demand for what I'm building, and identify areas that the competition has not been executing well in.

The way I've decided upon is to build a landing page extolling the biggest differentiating factor that I see ranktracker.io having which none of its competitors have - a proprietary metric that shows the keywords that are close to ranking higher in the first page of the SERPs. This will allow the user to prioritize their SEO efforts on the keywords that are easiest to rank higher and optimize their investments in on-page optimization, content creation, and backlinking to drastically improve ROI. Hopefully this is enough of a killer feature to convince folks who are currently using a competitor to switch, and draw in customers that are on the fence to ranktracker.io.

I'll drive traffic to the landing page with AdWords and maybe Facebook ads to start off. After I collect some email leads, I'll also offer their first month for free if they let me know what features are important to them and what they feel like is missing, so I can prioritize feature development.

### Landing Page + Mailing List + Survey

The tool I'm using to build the landing page is called [LanderApp](http://www.landerapp.com), which I chose over Unbounce because I really like having a free tieralong with their ability to A/B test automatically. Unfortunately, the free tier doesn't come with Mailchimp integration, but I'll just import the subscribers by hand since I don't expect the volume to be terribly high. That also means I have to limit my A/B tests to a single round so that I get enough traffic for statistical significance, especially since I don't have an unlimited budget.

The default free tier of LanderApp doesn't have mailing list integration, but it will send an email to alert you of a new subscriber, so I'm going to try to connect that functionality to Mailchimp via Zapier. Then through Zapier again, I can automatically send out a survey to ask new subscribers what features they are looking for in a rank tracker and offering a free month of ranktracker.io service as an incentive to fill it out.

Honestly, Zapier is probably overkill since I don't plan on running the campaign / landing page forever, so I can just do it manually if I need to. If the Zapier integration takes a lot of time / effort I'll just go manual, but I just wanted to point out that this could be completely automated (theoretically).

### AdWords Campaign

Speaking of budgets, in order to keep a cap on costs, I'll run $25 worth of ads to get a general idea of the clickthrough rates I should be getting and the cost per lead. In addition, once I hit the cap I'll have another $100 in Adwords credits to play with, so that I can continue to hone the landing page based on the A/B test results and hopefully drive down the cost per lead while increasing conversions. Hopefully LanderApp has support for multi-arm bandit instead of the usual evenly distributed algorithm...

Keyword research is crucial for this part but I can't give up the secret sauce here - suffice to say that I'll be very careful and deliberate in my choices of keywords to run ads on, in an attempt to maximize visibility amongst only the most qualified traffic while simultaneously shying away from oversaturated keywords whose CPCs are too high to be worthwhile. Also, I'm well aware that the content of the landing page, along with the bounce rate will strongly affect the CPC, so I'm making sure to customize the landing page to be super targeted for the keyword groups that I select.

I'll start running the campaign on Sunday since I expect traffic to be minimal on the weekend. This way I can tweak the campaign if necessary so that it's ready on Monday for presumably normal traffic volumes.
