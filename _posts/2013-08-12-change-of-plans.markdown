I have a confession to make - I went back to my old ways, and started just working on the ranktracker.io product instead of doing any sort of customer development.

I do have some good reasons though (at least I think so). Since I have internal users waiting for this functionality, it didn't really make sense to keep it waiting, especially since I'm quite confident most of the MVP functionality I'm building out will be required in the final product for consumers anyways.

Also, although I'm pleased to announce that the AdWords campaign has launched, it hasn't picked up any traffic yet, despite the ads having been approved almost 6 hours ago. There's probably something wrong, most likely with regards to my maximum CPC bids set too low. I'll have to go back and investigate to figure out what exactly is going on to prevent my ads from running.

The landing page for ranktracker.io is pretty reasonable, with two different versions of the headline for A/B testing; basically it's checking whether exclusivity via beta invite is more alluring, compared to the promise of having a strong ROI on SEO. We'll see which one wins...

Customer development will not be abandoned completely though - I'll pound the pavement as soon as the MVP is ready. I like this strategy better as well since I'm just not confident selling a non-existent product, but I know it's something I need to get over. At least with a completed product that's had some internal testing I can get feedback on... but honestly I'm not pleased with my copout manuever. Maybe I'll grow a pair tomorrow, as time is ticking.
