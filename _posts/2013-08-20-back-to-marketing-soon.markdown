Nothing much to report today; mostly dealing with theme integration.

I had another problem pop up, which was that the theme I chose was only suitable for the application itself but not for the landing page, so I had to go back and pick another theme that complemented the admin theme. I wound up taking bits and pieces from different places to create the landing page, and also had to spend a ton of time tweaking things to look just right. It's still a work in progress with a lot of polish still missing, so I'm just going to put my head down and grind some more tomorrow.

Front end work takes a lot of time and effort, I'll be happy to be past that phase...

I'm also looking forward to doing some marketing again. I'm going to compile a list of SEO agencies and cold email them with a survey about rank tracking to figure out what tools they're using and what kind of features they are most interested in to make sure that I've covered my bases. They'll be offered a one month free coupon to ranktracker.io, free data migration from their existing rank tracking tool, and the results of the survey in return for their feedback, so hopefully a good percentage will bite.

This way I can be more confident about the minimum feature set required to launch, plus get a nice list of interested folks to market to when the app goes live.
