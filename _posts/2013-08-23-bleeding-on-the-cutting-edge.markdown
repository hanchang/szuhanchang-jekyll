In the past few days I've learned a valuable lesson in entrepreneurship the hard way:

> Do not use cutting edge technology when developing a business product on a limited budget (time OR money).

Rails 4 is giving me a lot of problems - most recently, I struggled with asset compilation on Heroku, but prior to that there was just a lot of indecisiveness over whether or not a gem would work out of box, whether a quirky behavior was a feature or a bug, and last but not least a lot of momentum lost from just having to go back and relearn some things to do them the Rails 4 way.

All of this is contributing to major slowdowns and morale dampening on a project that should have been relatively fast and straightforward, but more importantly, needed to ship TODAY. Unfortunately, it will not meet its deadline because of my bad decision to use Rails 4.

But on a project whose goal is to provide value to customers in exchange for money, I can no longer recommend using the latest and greatest until it has been battle tested by early adopters.

Keep in mind that I'm not saying to NEVER use cutting edge technology - there's a time and place for that as well, mostly on personal projects whose goal is to learn and play. In fact, there's a lot of benefits in doing so - contributing bug fixes and patches to give back to the community and earn some OSS stripes. 

In fact, I came to the same conclusion years ago regarding Ubuntu distributions, so I'm quite displeased at myself for not thinking of its corollary in terms of software development. 

It was mostly Joel Spolsky that led me astray - when he was interviewed about building Trello, he specifically chose to go with the bleeding edge tech stack, and I thought that was very noble and brave of him. Indeed it is, but I forgot a very important fact; he is well established with many products under his belt that are contributing to cash flow. I currently don't have that luxury, and as a result that is first and foremost my goal.

The more broad generalization is to keep your eyes on the prize - figure out what your primary goal is and make all decisions based on achieving that goal. If there are paths that sacrifice some progress towards the primary goal in favor of a secondary goal, make the tough decision and always go for meeting the primary goal, at all expense.

I won't forget this lesson anytime soon.
