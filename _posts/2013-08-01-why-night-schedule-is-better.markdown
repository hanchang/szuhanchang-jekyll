title:  "Why a Night Schedule Is Better"

I've tried for the last three months to wake early since I've heard all about the benefits of doing so.

After three months of religiously getting up around 6 or 7am, and then recently slipping back into my old schedule of going to bed at 2am and waking up at 9 or 10am the last few days, I've found that I am drastically more productive when using the night schedule.

That got me thinking as to why - the early morning schedule has a lot of supporters, tons of folks swear by it. It makes sense logically, since working on the difficult, creative stuff early on when your mind is fresh should yield the optimal results.

At first, I thought it might just be my laziness sabotaging me; at night there's a deadline called bedtime looming, whereas in the morning maybe I subconsciously feel like I have all day to get my todo list accomplished. 

But I realized the caveats of waking early, especially if the following apply:

* You happen to be in the Pacific time zone
* You are on a distributed team with members in the Eastern / Central time zone
* You cannot afford to NOT check email or ignore IMs during the day for some reason

All of those apply to me, and together they've conspired to make my mornings less productive than they could be for the following reason - I subconciously knew I only had an hour or two to work in peace before being interrupted.

Instead, I've found that a late afternoon / early evening nap allows me to have an extremely productive power session at night, because now I know I can focus for a long stretch of time without interruptions, potentially as long as I need to get the task at hand done especially if it's complicated code or whatever. Since I'm refreshed from the nap, I'm (almost) just as fresh as if I woke up in the morning.

Anyways, I just wanted to write this to let folks know to not force the early morning routine if the night works better. There's a reason us programmers are classically night owls...
