I just found out about the [FriendlyId gem](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id) and wanted to share / document it!

Basically, FriendlyId makes it easy to generate slugs or permalinks for Rails. I was planning on using this instead of using UUIDs for groups and keywords, but decided to go with UUIDs instead. However, I can see FriendlyId being very useful anytime you want to generate pretty URLs for SEO and human readability purposes.

Best of all, there's a Rails 4 version of the gem (although in beta), so no worries if you're interested in running the latest and greatest like I am.

Check it out, should be a useful tool in the toolbox.
