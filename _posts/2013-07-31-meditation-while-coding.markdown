### Before

I've always noticed how my productivity plummets when I'm waiting for code to compile or a script to run or Rails to load; inevitably I open up [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) and check out a couple of articles, but next you know, I've spent 30+ minutes reading stuff. Then I have to pull myself back to the task at hand, reload everything back into my brain's working memory, and pick up again. It's frightfully inefficient.

However, it's been a really hard habit to kick because it's so rewarding (reading all of the new stories is quite a dopamine rush) and simultaneously excusable, because I have nothing else to do for that single minute while the code compiles / the script runs / Rails loads.

I know it's not just me, either - often when I pair program with someone, I see them do the same, instead substituting Twitter or Reddit or whatever instead of Hacker News. It's a muscle reflex at this point.

Before, I used to put a limit on it by appending some text-to-speech functionality onto longer running commands; for example,

    git push heroku master

usually takes awhile since it's a deployment to Heroku, but I'd use something like

    git push heroku master; say 'Deploy complete!'

to have my Mac tell me when it's done and get me off of Hacker News. Unfortunately, often I either forgot to append the TTS or I'd keep reading because an article was really interesting. Regardless, context switching back to the task at hand always took a bit of effort.

### After

Recently I've been trying something drastically different instead - [meditating](http://zenhabits.net/fundameditate). During a long running command, I'll just focus on my breathing while I wait. It only takes a little bit of awareness but it's been paying HUGE dividends for my productivity lately - not having to context switch from reading an interesting article back to whatever I was doing feels amazingly easy. In fact, I think that subconsciously I'm still thinking about the problem or next steps, so my meditation clears the 

Meditation helps with patience and awareness in other things too, and this way I don't have to set aside extra time in the day to meditate. It's a huge win!

Give it a shot and let me know how it goes!

*Update*

I just realized that I started doing this at home on my own projects and not at work, probably because I was subconsciously aware that closing my eyes at work for two minutes will look like I'm napping. I'm going to try this out when I have a full time job again to see if anyone objects...
