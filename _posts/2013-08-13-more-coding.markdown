Not much to report or dwell on today - just a lot of implementation. I'm keeping things simple by not doing any sort of client side framework, especially since Rails 4 has built in Russian doll caching to make the UI zippier; originally I was researching whether or not to make the frontend a JavaScript app via Backbone or Angular or something, but decided to KISS for now.

Other than wasting some time doing research on the various JavaScript frameworks before deciding to just skip it, I basically just pounded out functionality for ranktracker.io. Most of the backend is done, with only graph display missing, and the frontend is coming along quite well, although not polished yet.

Also, there was good news regarding the Google AdWords campaign - they've started running. Initial results are actually quite impressive - 42 impressions, 2 clicks, and 1 conversion. Not bad for $0.89, but I'm a bit concerned about the volume. I may need to do additional keyword research to bump up the search volume, otherwise I'm not going to be able to get the data I need fast enough.

My ads are already getting a prety good quality score since they're ranking highly (average position of 1.4) with a relatively low Max CPC bid and a very low $0.45 actual CPC, so I'm not worried about running out of budget. Search traffic is definitely the bottleneck at this point, but I'm quite confident I chose all the related high search volume keywords already so I'm not sure what else to do. Worst case maybe I'll branch out into display traffic, but I'm going to go back in and double check the keyword estimated volume to make sure I'm not missing anything.
