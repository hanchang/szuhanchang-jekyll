After giving myself a little bit of time to feel sorry for myself, I'm rebounding from my previous mistake of using bleeding edge Rails 4 for my new business by consoling myself with the silver linings that came with the process.

Not only did I learn a lot about Rails 4, I also learned a lot about my problem domain and the tools I have at my disposal to solve them.

Unfortunately, it looks like it will not be easy to just downgrade my current Rails 4 app because of my use of UUIDs as primary keys - I don't plan on doing that again either, but thankfully with some copy and pasting I should be able to just spin up a new Rails 3 instance and move all the business logic over.

Live and learn!
