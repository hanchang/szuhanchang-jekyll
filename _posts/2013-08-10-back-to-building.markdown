Alrighty, now that I've gotten the marketing stuff handled, while I was creating the landing page I was bothered that I didn't have any screenshots of the software since it wasn't built yet. Normally I'd be okay with this, but since I need a rank tracker internally for a project, I realized that I should just go ahead and slap together a very basic but functional minimum viable product for internal use as well as a proof of concept for future customers. This will also let me put screenshots of the software on the landing page when the ads run tomorrow, and hopefully convince visitors that ranktracker.io isn't just vaporware.

Today will mostly consist of backend work to add support for grouping keyword/URL pairs into categories (mostly for separating clients if you're an SEO agency or for separating projects if you're an internet marketer). Since I need this for the internal project, I might as well just code it up; my guess is that it'll be a requirement in the final product anyways. 

Tomorrow will focus on nailing down the exact features that will make the cut in the MVP and then getting the frontend UI and UX up and running.

There's not a whole lot to share for now - it's execution time!
