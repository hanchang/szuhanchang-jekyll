  %p
    Created a Sinatra analytics app with <a href="http://d3js.org">D3 visualizations</a> backed by MongoDB. The Rails application sends analytics data via RabbitMQ and the Sinatra app receives, processes, and inserts them into Mongo. The Sinatra app facilitates querying into large volumes of data quickly for insights into site performance and user behavior. The project was completed within first two weeks of start date.
  %p
    Deployed the Sinatra analytics app to AWS EC2 via custom written Chef recipe.
  %p
    Implemented a new profile onboarding experience for <a href="http://www.kiss.com">Kiss.com</a>, which has 10+ million users.
  %p
    Heavily refactored the Kiss.com User model to DRY up repetitive code using metaprogramming.
  %p
    Proposed migrating Resque workers (processes) to Sidekiq workers (threads) to reduce memory consumption, which also reduces monthly AWS costs.

    Cofounder
    Sept 2012 - Current

    * Developed two factor authentication functionality to protect user accounts from phishing and other attacks; authentication methods include Google Authenticator and SMS via the Tropo API, integrated with Devise via session variables.
    * Developed tiered commission rate functionality, which decreases the commission rate when a user's trading volume exceeds certain thresholds, to encourage users to adopt the platform and trade more often.
    * Developed trade rebate functionality, which rewards a user with a rebate for adding liquidity to the order book and charges a user with a rebate for taking liquidity from the order book.
    * Developed a RESTful API for ticker, order book, account querying, and order placement / cancellation to allow third party charts access to exchange data as well as users to automatically trade. It uses token authentication instead of HMAC though, which I'd like to implement at some point in the future.
    * Integrated Rack::Attack gem to rate limit the API against malicious actors and rate limit login attempts for improved account security.

    Tech Stack: Rails 3.2.12, PostgreSQL, Memcached, Redis

    BitXF as an exchange is pretty much feature complete so I don't work on it much anymore other than minor tweaks and maintenance tasks. My cofounders are now carrying the brunt of the work, which mostly consists of marketing and customer service.

  %p
    Architected and programmed a real time risk metric calculation engine in C++ used to process a variety of equities, futures, and options market metrics used in analyzing performance and risk of automated trading algorithms for each brokerage account. This engine then communicated the metrics (up to 1000/sec) via a Lime proprietary RPC messaging system to the control plane.
  %p 
    Designed and developed PULP, a custom programming language that incorporates basic elements of equities measurements (e.g. open order value, current buying power, shares traded, etc.) combined with mathematical and boolean operators to build customizable risk metrics on demand that broadcasts the values to clients in real time. PULP used ANTLR 3 for parsing and lexing.
  %p
    Developed the client side portlet in Flex for viewing the real time risk calculation metrics. The data was obtained from the control plane configuration via our web services backend implemented in Java and sent to the Flex clientside frontend via AMF. The data was requested using a GUI that generated the PULP code necessary to calculate the metric.
  %p
    Worked with J2EE using a custom MVC architecture through JBoss/Tomcat, Hibernate + MySQL for data store, and Adobe Flex for front end visualization to create portlets for clients to access various account, market, and risk data.
  %p 
    Experimented with CUDA, an nVidia architecture used to take advantage of the parallel processing power of GPUs to reduce computational running time.
  %p
    Prepared and demonstrated presentations of this technology to both internal users and potential customers.
